=========== 1. First Order Logic ===========

The ingrediants of 1st order logic are:
    
    universal quantifier ∀ 
    existential quantifier ∃ 
    logical connectives ^, V, ~
    parentheses
    variables x_0, x_1, x_2, ... (these can be viewed as booleans)
    the equality symbol =
    non-logical symbols, namely, relations P(x_0, ..., x_k) over variables 

In 1st order logic, you can write properties, such as

    ∀ x ∃ y ( ~ x ) V ( y = x ) V Good(x)

    // where Good is a predicate

You cannot connect properties with equality, i.e., you can't write

    ∀ x ~ x = ∀ x ~ ~ ~ x

But you can write

    ∀ x (~x = ~ ~ ~ x)

Note that such properties can be evaluated by enumerating all possible values
of the variables.

    if x = 0 then ~x = ~0 = 1, and
    ~ ~ ~ x = ~ ~ ~ 0 = ~ ~ 1 = ~ 0 = 1.

    if x = 1 then ~x = ~1 = 0, and
    ~ ~ ~ x = ~ ~ ~ 1 = ~ ~ 0 = ~ 1 = 0.

Usually we do this with a truth-table.

By the way, in 2nd order logic, you can reason about properties, such as

    ∀ Φ ∃ Ψ ( Φ = ~ Ψ )

however you cannot do this in 1st order logic.

A MODEL "M" is a set of axioms and derivation rules from which you can derive
the truthood of a statement.  If a property Ψ can be proven using the axioms M,
then we can write M ⊢ Ψ.  If the property Ψ is true about every model in which 
the axioms M are true, then we write M ⊨ Ψ.  

Fun fact: Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem says that for every 
    language of formulas L,
    for every model M over the language L,
        one of the following holds:
    
    - there exists a formula Φ in L where M ⊨ Φ but M does not ⊢ Φ.  
    In other words, Φ is true about M, but we cannot prove it using M alone.
    
    - there exists a formula Φ in L in which M ⊢ Φ but also M ⊢ ~Φ.
    In other words, M is inconsistent.

If you'd like to learn more about this, let me know - I could hold an event in 
the future where I walk through my favorite version of the proof of the theorem.

========== 2. Words and Languages ==========

An "alphabet" is a finite non-empty set.

Let A be an alphabet.  Then A* is the "free monoid" below:

    A* = { a_0 ... a_k | k is a natural number and each a_i is in A }

Any element of the set A* is called a "word".

Any subset of A* is called a "language".
    
    Specifically, if L is a subset of A*, we say L is a language over the
    alphabet A.

Example:

    A = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
    A* = the natural numbers
    the even naturals are a language over A

Some useful definitions:

    x y z is a subword of x y z k
    
    the length of x y z, denoted | x y z |, is 3
    
    if w = x y z z h then |w|_y is 1, and |w|_z is 2
    
    w is called multilinear if for each a in A, we have |w|_a <= 1
    
    x y is a left factor or prefix of x y z
    
    y z is a right factor or postfix of x y z
    
    if a factor is not the entire word then it's called proper
    
    a b c and 1 2 3 are subwords of a 1 b 2 c 3 

    the initial of a b c is a and its ending is c

    Produce of words w, j is the word wj

        product is associative
        not commutative

    Denote by 1 the empty word

    Note: u^p u^q = u^p+q

        because u^p has length p
        u^q has length q
        so u^p u^q has length p + q and consists of only us
        and is therefore u^p+q

Operators on languages:

    union
    product
    complement
    subtraction


===== 3. Finite Deterministic Automata =====

Let Q be a set, A an alphabet, and * : Q x A -> Q an action.
Then the tuple (Q, A, *) is called an automaton.

    // By action, he just means, it's a relation on Q x A x Q.

    If Q is finite then (Q, A, *) is called "finite".

    If * is a function then we call (Q, A, *) "deterministic".
