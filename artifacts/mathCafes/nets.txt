On Definition 2.3 (F_del and G_sig):
    
    uncountable intersection example:

        irrat = bigcap { { r }^c : r a rational } 
            
            are a countable intersection of open sets

    Open question (for us):
        is there any set that is neither G_del nor F_sig?

2.2 Neighborhoods and closures

    A^circ means "interior of A" means largest open set within A.

        - every set has a boundary but the boundary might be the empty set

        impose standard topology over X = [-4, 10]

        WRONG: boundary of X = { -4, 10 }

        and X is clopen

        Errattum: Your space X always has empty boundary as otherwise you'd
        have a point that non-trivially intersects with stuff outside the space,
        but by definition such stuff does not exist.

        We KNOW all open sets DO NOT CONTAIN their boundary points.

REGARDING perfect subspaces:

    Consider the real line.

        { 4 } U [0, 1] is not perfect as shown by considering (3.5, 4.5)
        

    if 4 were a limit point in A
        there would exist a sequence, in A, converging to 4, containing stuff other than 4
        implying that there are elements of A arbitrarily close to 4
        implying that every neighborhood of 4 in A contains a point of A other than 4
            namely one of those arbitrarily close things from the sequence

    { 4 - 1/n | n in Nat }
        will contain 4 - 1/2 = 3.5
        but there is no sequence WITHIN that sequence which conveges to 3.5
        hence 3.5 is not an accumulation point
        hence, the sequence is not perfect  



        ( ( A  B ) C )

        in this one, ( A B ) is perfect
        because every neighborhood of A has B and vice versa


        so in conclusion they don't need to be "big"

BTW If you ever have someone ask for a good intro to pre-orders and such things,.
chapter 1 of this text is very very nice (according to me, Max): https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Galois.pdf

    a in A
    b in B
    (a, b) in A x B

    Munkres writes a x b in A x B

    a x b x c is in A x B x C

    as opposed to ((a, b), c) or (a, (b, c))

    (a, b) in A x B and c in C
    (a, b) x c = (a, b, c)
        looks kind of weird

        compared to a x b x c

        also kind of nice in power-set spaces which you do a lot of in topo.
            so basically the notation handles the obvious isomorphism for you.

{ (ra, rb) | ra, rb are rational }

    (-pi, e)

    Union (-1 * first N digits of pi | N in nat, similar for e)

    Hence, we proved (ish) that R1 is 2nd countable.


C(X) is the space of continuous functions X -> X

    A function f : X -> Y on topological spaces (X, T_X) and (Y, T_Y)
    is considered continuous if and only if, for all O_Y in T_Y,
    f^-1 O_Y is in T_X.

    2.2.7

    Consider the topology (R, T) where T is defined below.

    T = {
        A | x in A -> exists U open in R,
                      exists C countable,
                        such that U - C is a subset of A
    }

    A base for T is the set
        B = { U - C where U is open in R and C is countable }

    Only points in this space that converge are ones that are eventually constant.

2.28 Theorem - Let f : X->Y be a function and x in X.
Let (X, T) and (Y, G) be the corresponding spaces.
TFAE:
    I.   f is continuous at x.
    II.  if a net x_a -> x in X, then f(x_a) -> f(x) in Y.
    III. if a filter F -> x in X, then f(F) -> f(x) in Y.

PROOF.

    Suppose f is continuous at x.
    <-> For every open neighborhood V of f(x), 
        f^-1(V) is a neighborhood in X containing x.



    Let F be a filter in X and suppose x is a limit point of F.
    Therefore the closure of any s in F contains x.
    Thus f(closure(s)) contains f(x) for each s in F.
    Recall that f(closure(s)) <= closure(f(s)) as f is continuous.
    Thus closure(f(s)) contains f(x) for each s in F.
    But this suffices to show that f(F) -> f(x) in Y.
    So we have proven that I -> III.


    Suppose {x_a} is a net and x is a limit point of it.
    Consider the filter F generated by this net.
    It has the same limit points.
    So x is a limit point of F.
    So by prior logic, f(F) -> f(x) in Y.
    We still need to show f(x_a) -> f(x) in Y.
    NTS: Let V be an arbitrary nbrd of f(x), and a be arbitrary index.

         We claim: exists b >= a s.t. x_b in V.
         TODO - work on this more next time.

Proof of 2.32 Lemma in Hitchhiker's Guide:



    K is a compact subset of a T2 space

    Consider J = { (O, V) : k is in K and O is an 
    open neighborhood of k and V is an open neighborhood of x
    and O intersect V = emptyset }

    Notice all these pairs must exist because the space is T2

    Clearly the set of all the Os is an open covering of K

    By compactness of K, there exists a finite subset of this set,
    which is likewise an open covering of K

    Take the finite subset of corresponding Vs, and take its 
    (finite) intsersection; this must also be open as finite
    intersection of open sets is open, and must include x because each
    V contains x

    Call this new set V_final

    Call the union of the finite collection of Os we came up with, O_final

    Clearly O_final intersect V_final = emptyset

    and O_final contains K and V_final contains x

    QED

Claim: Compact subsets of T2 spaces are closed.

    recall that arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.

    Let K be a compact subset of a T2 space.

    For each point x not in K, let (O_x, V_x) be a tuple such that O_x, V_x are both open sets, O_x contains K, and V_x contains x, and the intersection of O_x, V_x is the empty set.

    Now take the intersection of all the V_x^c's for all the xs not in K.

    This is an arbitrary intersection of closed sets that must contain all of K.

    Indeed, this set cannot contain any x NOT in K, as to do so, it would need to contain an open neighborhood V_x, which cannot be the case
    as it's part of the intersection with V_x^c.

    So, this set doesn't contain anything not in K, and does contain K, therefore by excluded middle, the set is K.

    QED.

Ansatz: A homomorphism of groups can be thought of as a set isomorphism.

    Let (G, +) and (H, *) be groups.
    Let f : G -> H be a homomorphism of groups.

    So, importantly, f(x + y) = f(x) * f(y).

    Consider the set G_zipped = { (x, y, x + y) : x, y in G }
                     H_zipped = { () }

    Let h : G_zipped -> { (f(x), f(y), f(x + y)) | x, y in G } be the function

        h(x, y, x + y) = (f(x), f(y), f(x + y))
                       = (f(x), f(y), f(x) * f(y))
                       = H_zipped

    Because f is a homo. of groups, we were able to make
    a function h which was obviously equivalent, where h
    was a set isomorphism.

    f(a) = x if and only if (x, 0, x) = h(a, 0, a).

G = (N, +)
H = ({ 0 }, +)

f(x) = 0

    Conclusion: Max's Ansatz is wrong.
